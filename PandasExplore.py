# we want to generate a team,
# team size must be 11 players
# minmax GW:1, DEF = (3,5), MID= (3,5), FWD= (1,3)
#so our formations are: 
# DEF 5, MID=3,FWD,=1 
#DEF 4, MID=3,FWD,=2 , DEF 4 MID 4 FWD 2, DEF 4, MID 5, FWD 1 
# DEF 3, MID= 4, FWD = 3 - DEF 3 MID 5 FWD 1 



# I want to be able to genrate an list of players
